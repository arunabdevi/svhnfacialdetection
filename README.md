The SVHN digit recognition project using deep learning focuses on developing a model to recognize digits in street view images. The project begins with data acquisition from the SVHN (Street View House Numbers) dataset, which contains real-world digit images. Data preprocessing includes normalization and resizing of images. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed for the task, comprising convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for reducing spatial dimensions, and fully connected layers for digit classification. Key performance indicators (KPIs) include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, with target benchmarks typically around 90-95% accuracy. The model's performance is evaluated on a test set distinct from the training data, with hyperparameter tuning conducted to enhance accuracy. The final model is capable of accurately recognizing digits in varying conditions and is integrated into applications for automated digit recognition, such as address reading or postal code identification.
